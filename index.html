<h1>Bradley Ross projects</h1>
<p>This page should be accessible at
   <a href="http://Bradleyross.github.io/documentation/index.html"
   target="_blank">http://Bradleyross.github.io/documentation/index.html</a></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to serve as a repository for my experiments with version 3
   of the dcm4che (<a href="http://www.dcm4che.org" target="_blank">http://www.dcm4che.org</a>)
   library.</p>
<ul>
<li>BradleyRoss/documentation is the documentation
    for my projects and this is the landing page for that project.  Besides my notes, it also contains
    Javadocs for the dcm4che toolkit and my personal code.</li>
<li>BradleyRoss/bross_readme is my personal library for working with the toolkit plus some other
    utility classes.  I will also use this project for some additional personal projects.</li>
<li>BradleyRoss/dcm4che is a fork of the dcm4che/dcm4che project.  The main difference is some 
    additional documentation.  It contains multiple projects.
    <ul>
    <li>dcm3samples contains my Java code and the Ant script for building it.</li>
    <li>javadocs contains the Ant script for building the Javadocs.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
