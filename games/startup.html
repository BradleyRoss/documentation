<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a game of concentration where the goal is to find matching images.</p>
<p>The images come in three different sizes (small, medium, large) so that 
   you can have a better fit to the size of your screen.</p>
   <hr />
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>When the game starts, you will see a group of blank tiles arranged in
   a grid.  The tiles are blank with a border on one side and have an
   image on the other side.</p>
<p>When you click on a blank tile, it will be turned over and
   replaced by an image.  You should 
   then try to click on another blank tile that has the same image on
   the other side.</p>
<p>If both tiles have the same image, both tiles will vanish the next time you click on
   a tile or on a blank portion of the grid.  Otherwise, the next click will cause
   both tiles to flip over and show the blank side again.</p>
<p>The game is completed when you have removed all of the tiles from the grid.</p>
